# Introduction

One of my colleagues asked me: "What's your most practical skill in network science?" I told him:" **community detection**"! 

Whether you are a network science beginner, enthusiast, or expert, whether you study network data or other data networking, community detection technology will be able to accompany you at every stage of network analysis --- **from Network Data Preprocessing and Analyse, Network Visualization, Network Advanced Insight Acquisition...**

Community detection can be an organic part of your own models! The VGAER we developed provides an opportunity to combine cutting-edge GNN methods.

**Come and try!**


# VGAER

Simple and efficient -- a novel unsupervised community detection with the fusion of modularity and network structure:
